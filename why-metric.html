                <h1 class="main__title">Why Metric?</h1>
                <div class="main__descr">The metric system has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some countries already having made the switch, while others still hold on to their legacy measurement units. In this article, we will explore six reasons why adopting the metric system is important and beneficial. From the simplicity and efficiency of the metric system to the advantages it provides in international trade and education, there are compelling reasons why the metric system should be embraced. Let's dive in and discover why metric matters.</div>

                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">6. It's not going away</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>Adopting the metric system is an important task that has yet to be completed. Despite years of debate and discussion, many countries have yet to fully embrace the metric system, which has created a patchwork of measurement units. Until we decide to make the switch, our legacy measurement units will remain a thorn in our side, creating confusion and inefficiencies in our daily lives. <br><br>The metric system provides a standardized set of units that is easy to understand and use. With its logical and consistent framework, the metric system allows for easy conversion between different units without the need for complicated formulas or tables. By adopting the metric system, we can simplify communication and trade, making it easier to exchange information with others around the world. While it may require some effort to make the switch, the benefits of adopting the metric system far outweigh any short-term challenges.</p></div>

                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">5. What we have now is pretty lousy</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>The current system of measurement in the United States is a mess. The old legacy units, with their numerous and confusing variations, create a hodgepodge of measurements that make it difficult to communicate effectively. <br><br>Trying to switch between different units for the same measurement is cumbersome and confusing, and it can lead to costly errors. It's time to adopt the metric system, which offers a simpler and more consistent approach to measurement that can benefit everyone.</p></div>

                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">4. We're missing out</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>By sticking with the old legacy units instead of adopting the metric system, we're missing out on the simplicity and standardization that comes with a well-designed measurement system. Metric units really do form a "system" that old legacy units simply do not. <br><br>When people understand metric units and have the opportunity to use them, they have an advantage they wouldn't have if they were stuck with the old units. Conversations become easier to comprehend and there's no reason to settle for a second-rate system when a better one is available.</p></div>

                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">3. International trade</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>International trade can be hindered by the use of non-standard measurement systems. If the US continues to use legacy units while the rest of the world uses metric, it can create confusion and inefficiencies in global trade. Asking for special treatment in the form of converting measurements can also come with added costs. <br><br>To be competitive in the global market, it is essential for the US to adopt the metric system and be on the same page as the rest of the world.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">2. Understanding metric is not optional if you claim to be educated</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>In today's globalized world, understanding the metric system is a fundamental aspect of education. Just as being able to locate Asia on a map or count to one hundred are basic skills, knowing metric units is essential if you want to participate in many fields of study and work.<br><br>There are some minimal standards of education that are required if you want to be part of the conversation, and the metric system is a crucial part of that. Much of the intellectual life of the country relies on the metric system, so not knowing it can be a significant disadvantage.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric__block">
                    <h3 class="metric__title">1. It's doable!</h3>
                    <div class="metric__descr"><p>Other countries managed to make the switch - it can be done! The real obstacle is not the dollar cost, it is getting enough agreement that we should make an effort to move down that path.<br><br>We are already partway there, and with the right mindset and commitment, we can make the switch to the metric system and reap the benefits of a standardized and efficient measurement system.</p></div>
